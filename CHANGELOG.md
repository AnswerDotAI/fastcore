# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 1.0.19

### New Features

- `run`: flexibly run an external process and raise exception if it fails ([#105](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/105))


## 1.0.16

### New Features

- add `threadpool=False` param to `parallel` to use threads instead of processes ([#102](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/102))


## 1.0.15

### New Features

- add `L.map_filter` and `L.map_first` ([#97](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/97))
  - These support some nice refactorings, like changing from this:
    ```python
    d = []
    for c in cs:
      m = f(c)
      if not m:
        continue
      d.append(m.group(1))
    ```
    to this:
    ```python
    d = cs.map_filter(f).map(Self.group(1))
    ```


## 1.0.14

### Bugs Squashed

- Reapply fix for #86 which was unintentionally reverted by the next commit ([#91](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/91))

## 1.0.13

### New Features

- `dict2obj`: Convert (possibly nested) dicts (or lists of dicts) to `SimpleNamespace` ([#90](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/90))

## 1.0.12

### New Features

- add function support to `store_attr` ([#85](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/85))

### Bugs Squashed

- `mp_context` keyword for initialising concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor only supported in python 3.7+ ([#86](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/86))

## 1.0.10

### Breaking Changes

- remove `parallel_chunked`, use `chunksize` arg to `parallel` instead ([#81](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/81))

### New Features

- move fastscript to fastcore.script ([#84](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/84))
- add `run_proc` and `do_request` ([#83](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/83))
- added `chunksize` to `parallel`, which passes to `ProcessPoolExecutor.map` ([#82](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/82))
- move metaclasses and delegates et al to new `meta` module ([#80](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/80))

## 1.0.4

### New Features

- Remove numpy prerequisite ([#75](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/75))
  - NB: fastcore's `L` and other collection features still work with numpy
    arrays, but they do so internally using instance methods, so numpy is no longer a
    prerequisite, and numpy is not loaded if not used

## 1.0.2

### Bugs Squashed

- "has default params. These will be ignored" shown when not appropriate ([#74](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/issues/74))

## 1.0.1

### Breaking Changes

- Change arguments of `store_attr()` and remove `store_attrs` attribute ([#71](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/71))
  - `store_attr`'s API has changed. `self` is now the second parameter, and is optional. Previously, if no names were passed to store,
    names were taken from the `store_attrs` attribute; now, however, names are taken from the list of arguments to the current function.

### New Features

- Warn if defaults passed to `typedispatch` ([#73](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/73))

- Add `urlread` and `urljson` ([#72](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/pull/72))

## Version 1.0.0

- Initial release
